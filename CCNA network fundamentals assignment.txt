1. DHCP Process Broadcast Messages
Which of the following messages in the DHCP process are broadcasted? (Choose two)

C. Discover: This message is broadcasted by the client to find a DHCP server.
A. Request: This message is also broadcasted by the client to request an IP address from the DHCP server after receiving an offer.
2. Command to Ensure ACL Does Not Block Web-Based TCP Traffic
Which command would you use to ensure that an ACL does not block web-based TCP traffic?

B. permit tcp any any eq 80: This command permits TCP traffic on port 80, which is used for HTTP web traffic.
3. Network Topologies
Explain Network Topologies
Network topologies refer to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. Common types include:

Star Topology: All nodes are connected to a central hub. Easy to manage but the hub is a single point of failure.
Bus Topology: All nodes share a single communication line. Simple and cost-effective but can lead to collisions.
Ring Topology: Each node is connected to two others, forming a circular pathway. Data travels in one direction. A failure in one node can disrupt the network.
Mesh Topology: Every node is connected to every other node. Highly reliable but expensive due to the number of connections.
Hybrid Topology: Combines two or more different topologies.
4. TCP/IP Networking Model
Explain TCP/IP Networking Model
The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols used for communication over the internet. It consists of four layers:

Application Layer: Interfaces with the end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
Transport Layer: Manages end-to-end communication and error recovery (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Internet Layer: Handles the routing of data packets across networks (e.g., IP).
Network Interface Layer: Deals with the physical transmission of data over network hardware.
5. LAN and WAN Networks
Explain LAN and WAN Networks

LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small geographic area, like a home or office. It typically offers high data transfer rates and low latency.
WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a larger geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs. It typically has lower data transfer rates and higher latency compared to LANs.
6. Operation of Switch
Explain Operation of Switch
A switch operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. Key functions include:

Frame Forwarding: Receives incoming frames and forwards them to the appropriate port.
MAC Address Learning: Builds a MAC address table to keep track of which devices are connected to which ports.
Collision Domain Segmentation: Reduces collisions by creating separate collision domains for each connected device.
7. Purpose and Functions of Various Network Devices
Describe the purpose and functions of various network devices

Router: Connects different networks, routes data packets, and manages traffic between them.
Switch: Connects devices within a LAN and forwards data based on MAC addresses.
Hub: A basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment.
Modem: Modulates and demodulates signals for data transmission over telephone lines or cable systems.
Access Point: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi.
8. Appropriate Media, Cables, Ports, and Connectors
Make a list of the appropriate media, cables, ports, and connectors to connect switches to others

Media: Ethernet (copper), Fiber optic
Cables:
Ethernet Cable (Cat5e, Cat6): For copper connections.
Fiber Optic Cable: For high-speed connections over longer distances.
Ports:
Ethernet Ports: Typically RJ45 for copper.
SFP Ports: For fiber optic connections.
Connectors:
RJ45 Connector: Used for Ethernet cables.
LC/SC Connectors: Used for fiber optic cables.
9. Network Devices and Hosts
Define Network Devices and Hosts

Network Devices: Hardware components that facilitate network communication (e.g., routers, switches, hubs, access points).
Hosts: Any device that is connected to a network and can send or receive data (e.g., computers, servers, smartphones).
