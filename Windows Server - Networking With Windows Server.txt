Windows Server - Networking With Windows Server


25. Role of Windows Firewall in Windows Server
Windows Firewall is a built-in security feature that helps protect Windows Server from unauthorized access and threats. It controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

Key Functions:
Packet Filtering: Blocks or allows traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Stateful Inspection: Monitors the state of active connections and determines which network packets to allow through the firewall.
Advanced Security: Provides options for configuring rules for specific applications or services.
Configuration Steps:
Open Windows Firewall:
Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall.
Create Rules:
Click on Advanced settings to access the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
Use the Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules to create new rules.
Enable/Disable Firewall:
You can turn the firewall on or off from the main firewall settings page.


26. Network Address Translation (NAT) in Windows Server
NAT allows a network to use private IP addresses internally while presenting a single public IP address externally. This is useful for conserving IP addresses and enhancing security.

Configuration Steps:
Install Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS):
Open Server Manager, navigate to Roles, and add the Routing and Remote Access role.
Configure NAT:
Open Routing and Remote Access from Tools in Server Manager.
Right-click your server and select Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access.
Choose Network Address Translation (NAT) and follow the wizard to configure the settings.


27. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other IP parameters to devices on a network.

Configuration Steps in Windows Server 2016:
Install DHCP Server Role:
Open Server Manager, go to Add Roles and Features, and select DHCP Server.
Configure DHCP:
After installation, open the DHCP Management Console.
Right-click on your server and select New Scope.
Follow the wizard to define the range of IP addresses and configure options like default gateway and DNS servers.


28. Configuring DNS (Domain Name System) in Windows Server
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access resources using human-readable names.

Configuration Steps:
Install DNS Server Role:
Open Server Manager, go to Add Roles and Features, and select DNS Server.
Configure DNS Zones:
Open the DNS Manager from Tools.
Right-click on your server and select New Zone to create a forward or reverse lookup zone.
Follow the wizard to configure the zone settings.


29. Server Manager
Server Manager is a management console in Windows Server that provides a centralized interface for managing server roles and features.

Key Uses:
Role Management: Install, configure, and manage server roles and features.
Performance Monitoring: Monitor server performance and resource usage.
Remote Management: Manage multiple servers from a single interface.


30. Remote Desktop Services (RDS)
RDS allows users to connect to a remote server and access applications and desktops over a network.

Configuration Steps:
Install RDS Role:
Open Server Manager, go to Add Roles and Features, and select Remote Desktop Services.
Configure RDS:
After installation, use the Remote Desktop Services Deployment wizard to configure session collections, licensing, and connection brokers.
Publish Applications:
Use the RemoteApp Manager to publish applications for remote access.
