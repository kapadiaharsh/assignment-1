The minimum number of partitions required to install Linux is one. This single partition can serve as the root directory (/), which contains all the system files. However, it's common to create additional partitions for better organization and management (e.g., /home, /swap, /var).

2. Chmod Command
The chmod command is used to change the file mode (permissions) of a file or directory in Linux. It allows you to specify who can read, write, or execute a file.

Syntax: chmod [options] mode file
Modes:
Numeric:
7 = read, write, execute (rwx)
6 = read, write (rw-)
5 = read, execute (r-x)
4 = read (r--)
Symbolic:
u = user (owner)
g = group
o = others
a = all
Example: chmod u+x file.txt (adds execute permission for the user)



3. Check Linux Memory Utilization
To check memory utilization in Linux, you can use the free command:


free -h
This command provides a summary of memory usage, including total, used, free, shared, buffer/cache, and available memory.



4. Use Grep to Search for Specific Patterns in Files
The grep command is used to search for specific patterns within files.

Syntax: grep [options] pattern [file...]
Example: To search for the word "example" in a file named file.txt:
Copy
grep "example" file.txt


5. Connecting to a Linux Server via SSH
To connect to a Linux server using SSH, use the ssh command followed by the username and server IP address or hostname.


ssh username@server_ip


6. Create 5 Files in the /tmp Directory and Compress Them
To create five files and then compress them using tar and gzip, follow these commands:


cd /tmp
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
tar -cvf files.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
gzip files.tar


7. Describe the Root Account
The root account is the superuser account in Linux. It has unrestricted access to all commands and files on the system. The root user can perform administrative tasks, manage system settings, and install software. It is recommended to use the root account sparingly to avoid accidental system changes.


8. What is Shell?
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It interprets user commands and executes them. Common shells in Linux include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.


9. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and it supports a variety of hardware architectures.


10. What is Bash?
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular command-line shell and scripting language for Linux and Unix systems. It is the default shell for many Linux distributions and provides features like command history, job control, and scripting capabilities.


11. First Step for a New Empty Hard Drive for Linux
The first step is to partition the hard drive using a tool like fdisk or parted. You will define the partitions needed for the installation.


fdisk /dev/sdX  # Replace sdX with your actual drive identifier


12. Command to Show the Current Working Directory
To display the current working directory, use:


pwd


13. Command to Get Help with Various Options
To get help with commands and options, you can use:


man command_name  # For manual pages
or

Copy
command_name --help  # For help option


14. Command to Display What All Users Are Currently Doing
To see what users are currently doing, use:

Copy
w


15. Command to Get Information About the Operating System
To get information about the operating system, use:

Copy
uname -a


16. Command to Create a Hard Link of a File
To create a hard link, use:

Copy
ln original_file hard_link


17. Command to Create a Soft Link of a File and Directory
To create a soft link (symbolic link), use:

Copy
ln -s original_file soft_link
ln -s /path/to/directory soft_link_directory


18. Command to Search for a Specific Pattern in a File
To search for a specific pattern, use:

Copy
grep "pattern" filename


19. Command to Show the Use of Basic Regular Expressions Using Grep
To demonstrate basic regular expressions with grep, you can use:

Copy
grep '^start' filename  # Lines starting with 'start'
grep 'end$' filename    # Lines ending with 'end'
grep 'a.b' filename     # 'a' followed by any character and then 'b'
