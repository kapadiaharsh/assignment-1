31. Installing and Configuring Hyper-V Virtualization in Windows Server 2016
Check System Requirements: Ensure your hardware supports virtualization (Intel VT or AMD-V).
Install Hyper-V:
Open Server Manager.
Click on Add roles and features.
Select Role-based or feature-based installation.
Choose your server and select Hyper-V from the roles list.
Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
Configure Virtual Switch:
Open Hyper-V Manager.
Click on Virtual Switch Manager.
Create a new virtual switch (External, Internal, or Private).
Create Virtual Machines:
In Hyper-V Manager, right-click on your server and select New > Virtual Machine.
Follow the wizard to configure VM settings (memory, storage, network).
Start and Manage VMs: Use Hyper-V Manager to start, stop, and manage your virtual machines.


32. Monitoring Server Performance and Managing Event Logs in Windows Server
Performance Monitoring:
Use Performance Monitor (perfmon) to track system performance using counters.
Set up alerts for specific thresholds (CPU, memory, disk usage).
Event Logs:
Access via Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc).
Review logs under Windows Logs (Application, Security, System) for issues.
Use Filter Current Log to find specific events.


33. Different Types of Storage Options Available in Windows Server
Direct Attached Storage (DAS): Storage directly connected to the server.
Network Attached Storage (NAS): Storage accessed over a network (file-level).
Storage Area Network (SAN): High-speed network providing block-level storage.
Hyper-V Virtual Hard Disks (VHD/VHDX): Used for virtual machines.
Storage Spaces: Allows pooling of disks to create resilient storage solutions.


34. Role of File Server in Windows Server and Configuration
Role: A File Server provides shared access to files and folders across a network.
Configuration:
Install the File Server role via Server Manager.
Create shared folders and set permissions.
Configure Quota Management to limit storage usage.
Enable DFS for better file replication and availability (if needed).


35. Implementing and Managing Distributed File System (DFS) in Windows Server 2016
Install DFS:
Open Server Manager and add the DFS role.
Configure DFS Namespaces:
In DFS Management, create a new namespace.
Add folders to the namespace that point to shared folders.
Set Up DFS Replication:
Create a replication group.
Add folders for replication and configure schedules.
Monitor DFS: Use the DFS Management console to monitor the health and status of your DFS setup.


36. Built-in Backup and Recovery Options in Windows Server 2016/2019
Windows Server Backup: A feature that allows for scheduled backups of the server, including system state, files, and applications.
System Image Backup: Creates a complete image of the server for disaster recovery.
File Recovery: Allows for granular recovery of files and folders.


37. Configuring Windows Server Backup to Back Up Critical Data
Install Windows Server Backup:
Use Server Manager to add the Windows Server Backup feature.
Open Windows Server Backup:
Launch the application from Administrative Tools.
Create Backup Schedule:
Click on Backup Schedule and follow the wizard.
Select backup type (full, incremental) and specify critical data locations.
Choose Destination: Select local disk, external drive, or network share for backups.


38. Restoring Files and Folders Using Windows Server Backup
Open Windows Server Backup.
Click on Recover.
Choose recovery location (local server or another server).
Select backup date and time.
Browse to find the files or folders you wish to restore and follow the prompts to complete the recovery.


39. Common Troubleshooting Techniques for Windows Server Startup Issues
Check Hardware: Ensure all components are functioning.
Boot in Safe Mode: Access advanced startup options to troubleshoot.
Review Event Logs: Look for errors in the System log.
Use Last Known Good Configuration: If applicable.
Repair Installation: Use installation media for repair options.


40. Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Problems in Windows Server
Check Physical Connections: Ensure cables and switches are functioning.
IP Configuration: Use ipconfig to check IP settings.
Ping Test: Ping local and external addresses to diagnose connectivity.
Check Firewall Settings: Ensure that firewall rules are not blocking traffic.
Review Event Logs: Check for network-related errors.


41. Common Active Directory-Related Issues and Their Troubleshooting Steps
Replication Issues:
Use repadmin /replsummary to check replication status.
Ensure time synchronization across domain controllers.
Login Problems:
Verify user credentials and account status.
Check for account lockouts or expired passwords.
DNS Issues:
Ensure DNS is configured correctly for AD functionality.


42. Troubleshooting Performance Problems on Windows Server 2016/2019
Use Performance Monitor: Identify resource bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk).
Task Manager: Check running processes and resource usage.
Event Viewer: Look for warnings or errors that might indicate issues.
Disk Cleanup: Remove unnecessary files to free up space.
Update Drivers and Software: Ensure all components are up to date.
