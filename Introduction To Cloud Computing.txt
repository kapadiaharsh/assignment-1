Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is a technology that allows users to access computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet instead of using physical hardware on their own machines.

In simple words:
Cloud = Internet-based computing.
You use resources online without owning or managing them physically.

Examples: Google Drive, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Netflix streaming, Gmail.

Key Features of Cloud Computing
1. On-Demand Access

You can access cloud services anytime without waiting for manual setup.

2. Scalability

Resources can increase or decrease automatically based on your needs.

3. Pay-as-you-go Model

You only pay for the services you use.
No need for expensive hardware.

4. Flexibility and Mobility

You can access your data and applications from anywhere using the internet.

5. Cost-Effective

No maintenance cost, no hardware purchase, no physical servers needed.

Types of Cloud Services (Service Models)
A) IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

Provides virtual machines, networks, storage, and servers.
Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs.

B) PaaS – Platform as a Service

Provides platforms for developers to build and run applications.
Example: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

C) SaaS – Software as a Service

Provides ready-to-use applications over the internet.
Example: Gmail, Zoom, Office 365, Google Docs.

Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud

Services are available to everyone on the internet.
Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

2. Private Cloud

Used by a single organization.
More security and control.

3. Hybrid Cloud

Combination of public and private cloud.
Balances security and performance.

Benefits of Cloud Computing

Reduced operational costs

No hardware installation

Easy data backup

High performance and speed

Global accessibility

Automatic updates

Strong security features

Real-Life Uses of Cloud Computing

Netflix uses cloud to stream movies

Banks store customer data securely in cloud

Gaming companies host online games

Companies use cloud for email, storage, websites, and virtual servers

Students use cloud for assignments and file storage (Google Drive)

Conclusion

Cloud computing is a powerful technology that provides internet-based computing services. It offers flexibility, cost-efficiency, scalability, and global access. Because of its reliability and easy availability, cloud computing has become the backbone of modern IT industries.
